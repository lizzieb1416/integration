--> make excecutables of my application in python with cx_Freeze: https://cx-freeze.readthedocs.io/en/latest/distutils.html
First make the file setup.py and then
* In Windows to create the build (.exe) and the installer, tape this in the cmd: 
  python setup.py build        -> If i just want to buil
  python setup.py bdist_msi    -> Creates the build and the installer
* In Linux, command line:
  python3 setup.py build -> It is a bit more complicated to make the installer, so i will leave it for another ocasion.
